# Zuci Backend - Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Monthly Customer Names Not Showing in Upcoming Washes ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Monthly subscription customers were not appearing in the `/api/leads/upcoming-washes` endpoint.

**Root Cause**: 
- The query was filtering leads by `assignedWasher: { $exists: true, $ne: null }` which excluded some monthly customers
- The logic for checking monthly subscription scheduled washes was not properly prioritized
- Population of `monthlySubscription.scheduledWashes.washer` was missing

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed the assignedWasher filter from the initial query
- Added proper population for `monthlySubscription.scheduledWashes.washer`
- Restructured the logic to check monthly subscriptions FIRST
- Improved fallback to `lead.assignedWasher` when `scheduledWash.washer` is null

### 2. Schedule Calendar API Not Working Properly ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Monthly customers were not showing up consistently in the calendar view (`/api/schedule/scheduled-washes`).

**Root Cause**:
- Similar to above - missing proper washer fallback logic
- Duplicate entries were not being handled correctly
- No source priority system for different wash types

**Fix Applied**:
- Added proper washer fallback logic (`scheduledWash.washer || lead.assignedWasher`)
- Implemented source priority system (monthlySubscription > oneTimeWash > washHistory)
- Added duplicate prevention logic
- Added `leadType` and `source` fields for better tracking

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities ⚠️ IDENTIFIED (Fixes Available)

**Critical Issues Found**:
- Missing authorization on multiple routes
- CSRF protection disabled
- Log injection vulnerabilities
- Hardcoded credentials in test files

**Fixes Available** (in `/fixes/security-fixes.js`):
- Add authorization middleware to unprotected routes
- Implement CSRF protection
- Add input sanitization for logging
- Environment variable validation

### 4. Performance Issues ⚠️ IDENTIFIED

**Issues Found**:
- N+1 query problems in dashboard routes
- Sequential database queries instead of parallel
- Inefficient date range calculations

**Recommendations**:
- Use `Promise.all()` for parallel queries
- Implement query optimization
- Add database indexes for frequently queried fields

## Files Modified

### 1. `/routes/leads.js`
- Fixed `upcoming-washes` endpoint (lines 140-300)
- Improved monthly subscription handling
- Added better logging for debugging

### 2. `/routes/scheduleWash.js`
- Fixed `scheduled-washes` endpoint
- Added source priority system
- Improved duplicate handling
- Enhanced monthly customer visibility

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test Monthly Customers in Upcoming Washes
```bash
# Test today's upcoming washes
GET /api/leads/upcoming-washes?date=today

# Test tomorrow's upcoming washes  
GET /api/leads/upcoming-washes?date=tomorrow

# Test weekly view
GET /api/leads/upcoming-washes?date=week

# Filter by Monthly type
GET /api/leads/upcoming-washes?date=today&type=Monthly
```

### 2. Test Schedule Calendar
```bash
# Test calendar view
GET /api/schedule/scheduled-washes?startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-01-31
```

### 3. Verify Monthly Subscription Data
```bash
# Check specific lead's monthly subscription
GET /api/leads/{leadId}/monthly-subscription
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Backup current database
- [ ] Test the fixed endpoints in development
- [ ] Verify monthly customers appear in both upcoming washes and calendar
- [ ] Check console logs for proper customer names

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Monitor server logs for any errors
- [ ] Test frontend integration with fixed APIs
- [ ] Verify monthly subscription workflows
- [ ] Check washer assignment functionality

### Security Improvements (Recommended):
- [ ] Apply security fixes from `/fixes/security-fixes.js`
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Implement input validation
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Remove hardcoded credentials from test files

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set before deployment:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production
```

## API Endpoints Status

### ✅ Working (Fixed)
- `GET /api/leads/upcoming-washes` - Monthly customers now show
- `GET /api/schedule/scheduled-washes` - Calendar now shows monthly customers
- `GET /api/leads/:id/monthly-subscription` - Working
- `POST /api/leads/:id/monthly-subscription` - Working

### ⚠️ Needs Security Review
- `GET /api/leads/stats/overview` - Missing authorization
- `GET /api/washer/:washerId/onetime-washes` - Missing authorization
- Multiple other endpoints - See security fixes

### ✅ Working (No Changes Needed)
- `POST /api/leads` - Create lead
- `PUT /api/leads/:id` - Update lead
- `GET /api/leads` - Get all leads
- Authentication endpoints

## Notes for Frontend Team

1. **Monthly customers should now appear** in both upcoming washes and calendar views
2. **Check the `leadType` field** to distinguish between Monthly and One-time customers
3. **Washer names** will now properly fallback to `assignedWasher` if specific wash washer is not set
4. **Console logs** have been added for debugging - check browser console for customer lists

## Support

If issues persist after deployment:
1. Check server console logs for the new debug messages
2. Verify database has monthly subscription data with `scheduledWashes` array
3. Ensure washers are properly assigned to leads or scheduled washes
4. Test API endpoints directly using the testing commands above
